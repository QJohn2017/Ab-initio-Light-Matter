# Notes #
* Details on what the intentions of the project will appear eventually
* Vulkan usage is dependent on double precision support (the spec hasn't been released yet)
* This is very much a work in progress.
* I am commiting as I work on unit tests to test specific library functionality.
* The various parts of the library will slowly appear.
